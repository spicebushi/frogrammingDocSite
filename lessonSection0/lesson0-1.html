                        When you walk, how do you do it? Do you just think about walking and do it? Do you use your legs? These are correct, but in this scenario, think like a computer.

                        Does a computer know what walking is, as you do? Would a computer know what a leg is without learning of it beforehand? You didn't know about them before learning of them, so the computer is no different.
